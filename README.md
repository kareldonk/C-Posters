# C++ Posters

These posters were originally created and submitted for [CppCon](https://cppcon.org/) 2019 but, unfortunately, were not accepted, although most of the CppCon Poster Review Committee appreciated the humor. Since I did put some amount of work into it and don't want that to be for nothing, I'm providing the posters here for anyone who wants to use them. Not only will they look nice in your office, but I'm quite sure that they will also start some interesting conversations.

The posters are available here for everyone to use under a *Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License*, **except** for the stock photo used on the poster `cppcon1.*`. **Before you use the `cppcon1.*` poster**, you can license the stock photo yourself from Alamy at the following link: https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-man-with-leg-amputee-in-a-wheelchair-preparing-for-a-race-35411286.html.

Replacing the stock photo is as easy as opening the PDF version of the poster in a program such as Adobe Illustrator and replacing the image. 

If you plan to make large prints, using the PDF versions will give you the best results.
